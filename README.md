Hi, my name is Filipe Carvalho!

I'm 20 years old, I live in Brasília, Brasil, and i'm actually studying Software Engineering at Univerdade de Brasília, UnB!
I created this perfil at GitHub because I'm starting my studies at programming, and I'm here to share and post my results over time, and I hope to being
a excelent programming!


Help yourself at here! 

Some little things about me:
- I love coffee;
- Love videogames;
- I'm a musician, actually playing guitar;
- I'm big fan of stylish, I really like to wearing some cool stuff;
- I love tecnology;
- I really love studying e and learning about new things.

That's it! I hope to see you soon! :)
